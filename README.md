# 🏗️ Smart Construction Model  

The **Smart Construction Model** is a comprehensive **web-based system** designed to **transform decision-making** in the **construction and real estate sectors** by integrating cutting-edge technologies.  

Traditional methods of **property search** and **construction planning** are often **time-consuming and inefficient**, requiring extensive efforts to gather information on aspects like **costs, available amenities, and market trends**. This project overcomes these challenges by employing a **dynamic frontend/backend system** with **machine learning insights**, using **React for the frontend, Node.js for backend services, and Python-based machine learning models**.  

## 🔍 Key Features  
The system consists of **four core functionalities** aimed at improving real estate decision-making:  

1️⃣ **📊 Cost Estimation**  
   - Provides **precise construction cost calculations** based on factors like area, materials, and labor requirements.  

2️⃣ **🏡 Property Search Engine**  
   - Allows users to **search housing societies** by **name or amenities**, helping them find the best-suited community.  

3️⃣ **📈 House Price Prediction**  
   - Utilizes the **XGBoost algorithm** to predict **future house prices**, leveraging historical data to assist users in **investment decisions**.  

4️⃣ **🤝 Society Recommendation System**  
   - Implements **K-Means Clustering** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to suggest **ideal housing societies** based on user **budget and preferences**.  

This project represents a **technological leap** in **real estate analytics**, providing users with **data-driven insights** for **informed decision-making**. 🚀  


## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React (Vite, Tailwind CSS)  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Flask  
- **Database:** Prisma, PostgreSQL  
- **Machine Learning:** Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas)
